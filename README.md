## Planneradora
• The plannedora will be a mobile application that helps
users with accessibility in their everyday life. It will have a variety of options for
adding different tasks onto a main landing page that shows you exactly what you
need to have accomplished and by what time. The user will be able to add their
tasks and modify them, as well as their begin and end date, and display that
information. It will use SQL to log the user in and out, as well as retrieve the
tasks that they have added to their account.

### The Architecture 
For the backend of our program we will be using
Java which one of the few programming languages that android studio offers and
mySQL for database since android studio has mySQL built in and for the
frontend of the program we will be using XML and HTML, most of the android
apps use XML for the front end of application which is easier to transfer files into
your application and using HTML to make the presentation better.
